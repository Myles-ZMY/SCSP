source code for paper Similarity Learning with Spatial Constraints for Person Re-identification

There are two main folds.

 The code in spatial_feat_extraction is to extract local patch descriptors and  reduce the feature according to global region nad local regions. 
   
 
 The code in spatial_learning_polynomial_map is about the similarity learning on polynomial feature map
